        <p> I have a well rounded background. I have worked everything from call center at Chadwicks of
          Boston to 1800-Medicare to direct support professional for adults with disabilities to Truck driver and a Substitute Teacher for
          elementary school children. Currently, when not working on school work, I do research into the different therapies available for autistic
          children to improve their lives and outcomes. One of my passions is helping individuals with disabilities, especially children, 
          get the most out of their lives as I have two special needs children at home and my goal for them is a mainstream life when they reach their teenage
          years and into adulthood.</p>
        <p> I am focused and driven to excel at what I am doing. I have been in the unique position that has
           allowed me to stay home and focus on my family which has given me to opportunity to learn new skills.I designed a spreadsheet 
           to track my husbands miles as well as rate of pay. I have also been able to keep an eye on his average miles driven through the year so we can pinpoint
           the slow times and better prepare financially from year to year. I have since turned the spreadsheet into an app to track his pay and miles</p>
        <p>I am self-motivated and ready to learn. I work well with others and feel I do my best work when working with a team.
           Team work allows me to continue to learn as well as put my skills to use on projects. I have a personality that allows me to be
           organized and think things through before I get started. I tend to do best when working with an outline or plan. I find that I
           structure myself in all things so I have steps to follow to allow myself to remain organized and easily track what I have done
           and where I am going.</p>
